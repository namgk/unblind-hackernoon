# Unblind Hackernoon's Blindingly Green

As a frequent reader, I always get eye sore looking at the green bar. If you're like me, pop this extension up to your Chrome browser.

# Notes

This removes the Hackernoon navigation menu!

This only works on page navigation (i.e from Google to Hackernoon), not on menu navigation within Hackernoon itself.
